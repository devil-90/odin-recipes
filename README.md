# odin-recipes
First odin project

#..............................................................................................................
#before starting the project

In this project first I am going to create an index.html file in the odin-recipes folder
In the index.html file there will be a basic html boiler plate and the heading h1 should be "“Odin Recipes”.

Next I have to create a directory named as "recipes".
In the recipes directory I have to create html pages with the recipe names.
The h1 heading of the html pages in the recipe directory should be the recipe name.
Then I have to link these pages in the index.html file

WHAT WILL BE IN THE RECIPE PAGE CONTENT:
    In the h1 tag there should be a image of the finished recipe.
    Under that image there should be some discription about that dish.
    Below that discription add another heading named "Ingredient" which contains unordered list of ingredients needed for the recipe.
    Then write the steps to make the dish using ordered list
    Repeate the same for other html pages.....
